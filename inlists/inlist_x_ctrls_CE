  ! extra booleans
   x_logical_ctrl(1) = .false.  ! include_internal_energy: If true, then the internal energy is included when the outer parts of the envelope are bound or unbound.
   x_logical_ctrl(2) = .true.   ! include accretion luminosity: If true, then accretion energy onto the NS is taken into account when calculating the energy donated to the envelope
   x_logical_ctrl(3) = .false.  ! use_pulse_wind use pulsational superwinds based of Yoon & Cantiello (2010) prescription
   x_logical_ctrl(4) = .false.  ! Remove supersonic outer layers
   x_logical_ctrl(5) = .true.   ! Remove outer layers when energetically unbound AND supersonic
   x_logical_ctrl(6) = .false.  ! is_it_restart: if true, then keeps companion position saved model and does not do initial synchronization. NOT WORKING CURRENTLY!!!
   x_logical_ctrl(7) = .true.  ! complete_orbit_integration:  if true the eq. of motion for the companion is solved using DOP8(5,3) integrator, taking hydrodynamic and dynamical drag and 2.5 Post-Newtonian correction, 
                                ! else, it is assumed that the companion's trayectory is tangential to the Keplerian circular orbit at its position.
   x_logical_ctrl(8) = .true.   ! initial_circular_velocity:  if true the initial velocity of the companion is computed for a circula orbit, alse both components will be considered from x_ctrl(20), radial, and x_ctrl(21), tangencial.
